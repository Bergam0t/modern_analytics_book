# Images

Images are created using a similar notation to links.

They are done in the format

`![]()`

- The ! lets markdown know it's an image
- Inside the [] you can optionally put some 'alt-text', which will display for screen readers or if the image fails to load for any reason.
- Inside the () you place a link to the image relative to the location of the document OR on the web.
