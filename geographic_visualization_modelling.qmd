# Geographic Visualisation and Optimization Problems

Geographic visualisation is a powerful and often underestimated tool.

We cover how to produce maps in both QGIS (a free and open source equivalent to tools like ArcGIS) - which is more user-friendly and doesn't require any knowledge of Python - as well as how to produce both static and interactive maps in Python.

We also cover how to tackle location optimization problems in Python - ensuring any new services are placed in the optimal location to minimize an objective such as the overall travel time for an area - and interact with travel time APIs to pull back travel time data at scale.
