# About This Section

While this module gets the title modern analytics, you could argue that all of our other content on HSMA comes under that umbrella too!

It's really part of your wider analytics toolkit.

As you head through this section, you will find links to the various HSMA books, videos, and code repositories relating to the topics taught on the course.

Apart from the introductory Python - as all of the techniques in the modern analytics module require a reasonable beginner/intermediate understanding of the Python programming language - none of these are prerequisites for this module - but they will enhance what you can create as an analyst.
