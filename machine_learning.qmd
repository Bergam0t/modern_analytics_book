# Machine Learning

Machine learning encompasses techniques such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, boosted trees and neural networks.
We cover how to use all of these techniques to develop predictive models.

While we don't have a full book on this topic, what we do have is a page that collates all of the lectures and repository links into a single place, as well as collating all of the example notebooks.
