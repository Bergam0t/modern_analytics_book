    "text": "Preface\nWelcome to the HSMA book of modern analytics.\nIn many ways, everything taught on the HSMA course is modern analytics! From module 2 on discrete event simulation to module 7 on collaborative development with github and web app development, the role of the analyst is becoming ever broader.\nSo why a module on modern analytics?\nThis module allows us to include a range of techniques that can contribute to your toolkit as an analyst.\nWe’ll also talk a little bit about what analytics and data science is and how to ensure its potential is maximised in organisations.\nWe’ll be covering a range of techniques.\n\nCreating documents with Quarto to allow you to automate analysis\nWriting tests to ensure your code is working as expected\nWorking with data from production sources, such as SQL databases\nAutomating the production of spreadsheets and slide packs\nForecasting future trends with\n\ntime series analysis (including naive forecasts, ARIMA, and Prophet)\nmachine learning\nsimulation\n\nProcess mining with the pm4py library\n\nWe’ll also provide a high-level overview on a range of other things it’s useful for the modern analyst to know about. We don’t have time to teach them all in the depth we’d like, but we can certainly point you in the direction of some resources to help you with all of the following:\n\nStatistics\n\ntests, such as\n\nt-tests\nchi-squared\nANOVA\n\nconcepts, such as\n\np-values\nconfidence intervals\n\nhow to use statistics appropriately, such as\n\nanalysis plans\ncorrecting for multiple comparisons\n\nBayesian vs Frequentist statistics\n\nWorking with time-to-event data\nGrabbing data from APIs, or from the wider web using web scraping\nThe R programming language and why you might want to learn it\nAssociation Rule Learning\nNetwork analysis\nWorking with ‘big’ data\nWorking with R and Python in other tools (e.g. PowerBI)\nCausal Analysis",
